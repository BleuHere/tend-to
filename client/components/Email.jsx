// to change the state when a certain goal is reached - for example
// all (20) plots are clear of weeds (aka all have state of soil)
// which then shows the email that guides you to fertilise the soil

// maybe, I want an array of objects (potentially an api?)
// one function ie. sendNextEmail which simply iterates over the array and
// sends the next one when the condition has been met.
